## API Key Management

### Current Implementation

- Implemented a centralized API key management system via `apiKeyManager.js`
- API keys are stored in environment variables and accessed through the secure manager
- Keys are validated at startup via the configValidator module
- API key usage is tracked and monitored for errors
- Support for key rotation is implemented
- All external API integrations now use the secure key manager

### Modules Using API Key Manager

- `openaiConfig.js`: Uses the key manager for OpenAI API access
- `weatherLookup.js`: Uses the key manager for RapidAPI weather services
- `wolframLookup.js`: Uses the key manager for Wolfram Alpha API

### Security Features

- API key masking in logs to prevent exposure
- Usage tracking to detect potential abuse
- Error monitoring for each API key
- Persistent storage of key usage statistics
- Support for key rotation and deactivation

### Remaining Recommendations

1. **Implement Automated Key Rotation**:

   - Create a key rotation schedule (e.g., every 30-90 days)
   - Set up automated alerts for key rotation
   - Document the key rotation process

2. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity patterns
   - Implement automatic temporary key disabling if abuse is detected
   - Add rate limiting based on key usage patterns

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Current Implementation

- Comprehensive input sanitization implemented via the `inputSanitizer.js` utility
- Centralized sanitization functions for different types of inputs (locations, queries, prompts)
- All external API calls now use sanitized inputs
- Input validation exists in the configValidator module
- User inputs for commands are validated before processing

### Modules Using Input Sanitization

- `openaiConfig.js`: Sanitizes all prompts sent to OpenAI API
- `weatherLookup.js`: Sanitizes location and days parameters
- `timeLookup.js`: Sanitizes location inputs for timezone lookups
- `wolframLookup.js`: Sanitizes query inputs for Wolfram Alpha API
- `quakeLookup.js`: Sanitizes server filter inputs
- `commands/modules/image.js`: Sanitizes image generation prompts

### Remaining Issues

- Consider implementing more specific sanitization for specialized inputs
- Add automated testing for input sanitization
- Possible injection vulnerabilities in plugin system

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Input Validation**:

   - Implement strict validation for all user inputs
   - Create a centralized input validation utility
   - Add length limits and character restrictions for user inputs

2. **Implement Input Sanitization**:

   - Sanitize all user inputs before processing
   - Remove or escape potentially harmful characters
   - Create a sanitization middleware for all incoming messages

3. **Prompt Injection Protection**:
   - Add safeguards against prompt injection attacks
   - Implement content filtering for OpenAI prompts
   - Create a prompt template system with strict boundaries

## Rate Limiting

### Current Implementation

- Good rate limiting system in place via rateLimiter.js
- Per-user rate limiting with customizable limits
- Special rate limits for resource-intensive operations (e.g., image generation)

### Issues Identified

- No IP-based rate limiting for the status page
- Potential for distributed attacks across multiple users
- No automatic blocking for persistent abuse

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Rate Limiting**:

   - Add IP-based rate limiting for all HTTP endpoints
   - Implement global rate limits in addition to per-user limits
   - Create a tiered rate limiting system based on user roles

2. **Abuse Prevention**:

   - Add automatic temporary blocking for users who consistently hit rate limits
   - Implement exponential backoff for repeated limit violations
   - Create an abuse reporting system for Discord server admins

3. **Rate Limit Monitoring**:
   - Add detailed logging for rate limit events
   - Create a dashboard for monitoring rate limit hits
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns of rate limit violations

## Error Handling and Logging

### Current Implementation

- Good structured logging with Pino
- Error handling with custom error classes
- Circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

### Issues Identified

- Potential for sensitive information in error logs
- Inconsistent error handling in some modules
- Limited error sanitization before sending to users

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Error Sanitization**:

   - Ensure all errors are sanitized before logging or user display
   - Create a centralized error sanitization utility
   - Add PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and redaction

2. **Standardize Error Handling**:

   - Ensure consistent error handling across all modules
   - Create error handling middleware for all user interactions
   - Implement proper error categorization (user errors vs. system errors)

3. **Security Event Logging**:
   - Add specific logging for security-related events
   - Create a security audit log
   - Implement log rotation and secure storage for logs

## Data Privacy and Storage

### Current Implementation

- Conversation history is stored persistently
- Some data pruning mechanisms exist
- Limited data minimization practices

### Issues Identified

- No clear data retention policy
- Potential for sensitive user data in conversation logs
- Limited user control over their data

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Data Retention Policies**:

   - Create clear data retention timeframes
   - Implement automatic data purging after retention period
   - Add data minimization practices to only store necessary information

2. **Enhance User Data Control**:

   - Add commands for users to delete their conversation history
   - Implement data export functionality for user data
   - Create privacy settings for users to control data collection

3. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement secure storage practices
   - Consider end-to-end encryption for sensitive conversations

## Authentication and Authorization

### Current Implementation

- Basic channel-based authorization
- Owner-only commands for sensitive operations
- Limited role-based access control

### Issues Identified

- Insufficient granularity in permission system
- No multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Limited audit trail for administrative actions

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Permission System**:

   - Implement a more granular role-based access control system
   - Create permission levels for different command categories
   - Add server-specific permission configurations

2. **Add Authentication for Sensitive Operations**:

   - Implement confirmation steps for destructive operations
   - Add time-limited tokens for sensitive administrative actions
   - Consider multi-factor authentication for critical functions

3. **Create Audit System**:
   - Log all administrative actions
   - Create an audit trail for permission changes
   - Implement non-repudiation for critical actions

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **API Key Rotation**: Implement a key rotation system and document the process
2. **Input Sanitization**: Create a comprehensive input sanitization system
3. **Data Retention Policy**: Establish clear data retention and purging policies

### Medium Priority

1. **Enhanced Permissions**: Improve the granularity of the permission system
2. **Security Monitoring**: Add monitoring for security-related events
3. **User Data Control**: Implement commands for users to manage their data

### Low Priority

1. **Audit System**: Create a comprehensive audit trail system
2. **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting strategies
3. **Security Documentation**: Create detailed security documentation for contributors

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Add API key rotation documentation
   - Implement basic input sanitization
   - Centralize all API key access

2. **Short-term Improvements** (1-2 weeks):

   - Enhance rate limiting
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add basic security monitoring

3. **Long-term Enhancements** (1-2 months):
   - Create comprehensive audit system
   - Implement advanced permission controls
   - Develop security training for contributors
