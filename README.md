This feature makes the bot more conversationally aware, allowing it to understand ongoing discussions even when they involve multiple messages or users.

### 🗨️ Intelligent Group Conversations 

**Finally, a bot that actually GETS group chat dynamics!** ChimpGPT's smart conversation system doesn't just collect messages - it understands them.

🧠 **Smart Message Weighting** - Automatically detects if you're talking to the bot or just chatting, and prioritizes accordingly

⏰ **Temporal Awareness** - Fresh messages get priority, old topics naturally fade (configurable 5-minute "memory window")

🎯 **Bot-Directed Detection** - Recognizes @mentions, questions, commands, and conversation patterns directed at the bot

🔄 **Reply Chain Intelligence** - Follows Discord reply threads to maintain conversation context and relationships

📊 **Relevance Scoring** - Each message gets a smart relevance score based on content, timing, and conversational intent

🧵 **Thread Awareness** - Groups related messages together and understands ongoing conversation topics

💭 **Ambient Context** - Includes background chatter for context without letting it dominate the conversation

⚙️ **Highly Configurable** - Tune memory duration, relevance thresholds, and weighting factors to fit your community

**The Result?** Your bot feels naturally intelligent in group settings - responding to the right people about the right things at the right time! No more confusion from cross-talk or irrelevant old messages cluttering the context.

### ⚙️ Conversation Configuration

- Plugins can add slash commands, message commands, and respond to bot lifecycle events.

### Creating a Plugin

1. Copy the template in `plugins/README.md`.
2. Create a new folder in `plugins/` and add your `index.js`.
3. Export an object with required fields (`id`, `name`, `version`) and optional `commands`, `functions`, and `hooks`.
4. Restart the bot to load your plugin.

### Plugin Validation

- Plugins are validated for required metadata and structure.
- Plugins are validated for required metadata and structure.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f0rky/Chimp-GPT
   cd Chimp-GPT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up the following environment variables (refer to `.env.example`).

4. **Linting & Code Quality**:

   - Before building or deploying, run the linter and fix all errors:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   - The build/deploy process requires a successful lint (no errors).

5. **Run the Bot**:

   ```bash
   # Using the start.sh script (recommended)
   chmod +x start.sh  # Make sure it's executable

   # Start in development mode (default)
   ./start.sh

   # Start in production mode
   ./start.sh -m production

   # Start only the status server
   ./start.sh -c status

   # Start only the Discord bot
   ./start.sh -c bot

   # Start in demo mode (no API keys needed)
   ./start.sh --demo
   ```

6. **Access the Status Page**:
   - Open your browser to `http://<STATUS_HOSTNAME>:<STATUS_PORT>` (default: http://localhost:3002 for development mode, http://localhost:3000 for production)

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

ChimpGPT can be easily deployed using Docker:

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Valid `.env` file with required environment variables

2. **Quick Start**:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chimp-GPT.git
   cd Chimp-GPT

   # Create .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Edit with your API keys and settings

   # Build and start the container
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   > **Note about environment variables**: The Docker setup mounts your local `.env` file directly into the container, so it will use the same environment variables you've set for development. This makes it easy to switch between local and containerized deployment without changing your configuration.

3. **Access the Status Page**:

   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file)

4. **View Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

For more details, see the [Docker Deployment Guide](docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 🏃 Run Modes

ChimpGPT supports different run modes via the included `start.sh` script:

```bash
# Start in development mode (default)
./start.sh

# Start in production mode
./start.sh -m production

# Start only the status server in demo mode
./start.sh -c status --demo

# Run tests
./start.sh -m test

# Start with debug logging
./start.sh --debug
```

Available options:

- `-m, --mode MODE`: Set run mode (production, development, test, demo)
- `-c, --component COMP`: Component to run (all, bot, status)
- `-d, --demo`: Enable demo mode (generates mock data)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `-q, --quiet`: Minimize logging (errors only)

### Performance Configuration

The bot includes several optimizations to ensure responsive performance, controlled via environment variables:

- `DISABLE_PLUGINS`: Set to 'false' to enable plugins or 'true' to disable them (default: true - plugins disabled)

  Disabling plugins significantly improves responsiveness (reducing message processing time by ~60%) and
  makes the "Thinking..." message appear much faster. Enable plugins only if you need their functionality.

For VSCode users, debugging configurations are available in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **General Interaction**:
Simply send a message in a channel where the bot is present to engage in a conversation. The bot implements a rate limiter that allows 30 requests per 30 seconds, with a 5-second cooldown after hitting the limit.

2. **Weather Inquiry**:
Ask the bot about the weather, for example: "What's the weather like in New York?"
And it will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide a natural response using the RapidAPI accurate weather information.

3. **Time Inquiry**:
Ask the bot for the current time, like: "Whats the time in New York?"
And it will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide a natural response including the time.

4. **Quake Server Stats**:
Use the command `!serverstats` or `/serverstats` or ask about Quake servers to get detailed information about active Quake Live servers, including player counts, maps, and ELO ratings.

5. **Wolfram Alpha Queries**:
Ask factual or computational questions, and the bot will use Wolfram Alpha to provide accurate answers.

6. **Slash Commands**:
The bot supports Discord's slash commands. Type `/` to see available commands:
- `/help` - Display information about available commands
- `/ping` - Check if the bot is responding
- `/serverstats` - Display Quake Live server statistics
