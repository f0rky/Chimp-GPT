### 🔗 Reply Context Enhancement

ChimpGPT now includes an intelligent reply context feature that makes conversations more natural and contextually aware:

- **Message Reference Resolution**: Automatically detects when users reply to messages and follows the reply chain
- **Context Extraction**: Extracts conversation context from referenced messages to maintain conversation flow
- **Configurable Depth**: Control how far back the bot looks for context in message reply chains
- **Intelligent Pruning**: Maintains conversation length limits while preserving important context

This feature makes the bot more conversationally aware, allowing it to understand ongoing discussions even when they involve multiple messages or users.

### 🗨️ Intelligent Group Conversations 

**Finally, a bot that actually GETS group chat dynamics!** ChimpGPT's smart conversation system doesn't just collect messages - it understands them.

🧠 **Smart Message Weighting** - Automatically detects if you're talking to the bot or just chatting, and prioritizes accordingly

⏰ **Temporal Awareness** - Fresh messages get priority, old topics naturally fade (configurable 5-minute "memory window")

🎯 **Bot-Directed Detection** - Recognizes @mentions, questions, commands, and conversation patterns directed at the bot

🔄 **Reply Chain Intelligence** - Follows Discord reply threads to maintain conversation context and relationships

📊 **Relevance Scoring** - Each message gets a smart relevance score based on content, timing, and conversational intent

🧵 **Thread Awareness** - Groups related messages together and understands ongoing conversation topics

💭 **Ambient Context** - Includes background chatter for context without letting it dominate the conversation

⚙️ **Highly Configurable** - Tune memory duration, relevance thresholds, and weighting factors to fit your community

**The Result?** Your bot feels naturally intelligent in group settings - responding to the right people about the right things at the right time! No more confusion from cross-talk or irrelevant old messages cluttering the context.

### ⚙️ Conversation Mode Configuration

ChimpGPT's conversation behavior is controlled by two key settings that work together:

#### **Setting Interaction Matrix**

| `USE_BLENDED_CONVERSATIONS` | `ENABLE_REPLY_CONTEXT` | **Result Mode** | **Description** |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `true` | `true` | **Blended with Reply Context** | Group conversations + reply chain following |
| `true` | `false` | **Blended Only** | Group conversations without reply context |
| `false` | `true` | **Individual with Reply Context** | 1-on-1 conversations + reply chains |
| `false` | `false` | **Individual Only** | Traditional individual bot conversations |

#### **Setting Details**

- **`USE_BLENDED_CONVERSATIONS`**: When enabled, combines messages from ALL users in a channel into shared context (max 5 messages per user to prevent dominance)
- **`ENABLE_REPLY_CONTEXT`**: When enabled, bot follows Discord reply chains to understand conversation context and thread relationships

#### **Mode Visibility**

The current conversation mode is displayed across all status pages:
- **Main Status Page**: Header shows mode with hover details (e.g., "💬 Blended with Reply Context")
- **Performance Dashboard**: Header displays mode with configuration tooltip
- **Settings Dashboard**: Shows detailed conversation configuration
- **Startup Logs**: Bot logs current mode configuration on startup
- **API Endpoints**: `/health` includes `conversationMode` object for monitoring

## Implementation Checklist

A detailed implementation checklist is maintained in [`CHECKLIST.md`](./docs/CHECKLIST.md). This tracks high, medium, and low priority tasks for code structure, security, performance, testing, developer experience, and deployment. Please review and update this file as you work on the project.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f0rky/Chimp-GPT
   cd Chimp-GPT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up the following environment variables (refer to `.env.example`).

4. **Linting & Code Quality**:

   - Before building or deploying, run the linter and fix all errors:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   - The build/deploy process requires a successful lint (no errors).

5. **Run the Bot**:

   ```bash
   # Using the start.sh script (recommended)
   chmod +x start.sh  # Make sure it's executable

   # Start in development mode (default)
   ./start.sh

   # Start in production mode
   ./start.sh -m production

   # Start only the status server
   ./start.sh -c status

   # Start only the Discord bot
   ./start.sh -c bot

   # Start in demo mode (no API keys needed)
   ./start.sh --demo
   ```

6. **Access the Status Page**:
   - Open your browser to `http://<STATUS_HOSTNAME>:<STATUS_PORT>` (default: http://localhost:3002 for development mode, http://localhost:3000 for production)

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

ChimpGPT can be easily deployed using Docker:

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Valid `.env` file with required environment variables

2. **Quick Start**:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chimp-GPT.git
   cd Chimp-GPT

   # Create .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Edit with your API keys and settings

   # Build and start the container
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   > **Note about environment variables**: The Docker setup mounts your local `.env` file directly into the container, so it will use the same environment variables you've set for development. This makes it easy to switch between local and containerized deployment without changing your configuration.

3. **Access the Status Page**:

   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file)

4. **View Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

For more details, see the [Docker Deployment Guide](docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 🏃 Run Modes

ChimpGPT supports different run modes via the included `start.sh` script:

```bash
# Start in development mode (default)
./start.sh

# Start in production mode
./start.sh -m production

# Start only the status server in demo mode
./start.sh -c status --demo

# Run tests
./start.sh -m test

# Start with debug logging
./start.sh --debug
```

Available options:

- `-m, --mode MODE`: Set run mode (production, development, test, demo)
- `-c, --component COMP`: Component to run (all, bot, status)
- `-d, --demo`: Enable demo mode (generates mock data)
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging
- `-q, --quiet`: Minimize logging (errors only)

### Performance Configuration

The bot includes several optimizations to ensure responsive performance, controlled via environment variables:

- `DISABLE_PLUGINS`: Set to 'false' to enable plugins or 'true' to disable them (default: true - plugins disabled)

  Disabling plugins significantly improves responsiveness (reducing message processing time by ~60%) and
  makes the "Thinking..." message appear much faster. Enable plugins only if you need their functionality.

For VSCode users, debugging configurations are available in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

## 📈 PM2 Management & Performance Monitoring

ChimpGPT is designed to be managed using PM2, which provides advanced process management capabilities. This section covers how to monitor and debug performance issues using PM2.

### Basic PM2 Commands

```bash
# View all running processes
pm2 status

# Start ChimpGPT
pm2 start combined.js --name chimpGPT

# Restart the bot
pm2 restart chimpGPT

# Stop the bot
pm2 stop chimpGPT

# View logs (most recent 100 lines)
pm2 logs chimpGPT --lines 100

# Monitor resource usage in real-time
pm2 monit
```

### Troubleshooting Slow Reaction Times

If you experience slow reactions from ChimpGPT, use these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Resource Usage**:

   ```bash
   # View real-time resource metrics
   pm2 monit
   ```

   Look for high CPU or memory usage which may indicate bottlenecks.

2. **Examine Logs for Delays**:

   ```bash
   # View error logs
   pm2 logs chimpGPT --err --lines 100

   # Search logs for timeout errors
   pm2 logs chimpGPT --lines 1000 | grep -i "timeout"
   ```

3. **Monitor API Response Times**:
   Access the performance dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/performance.html` to view detailed timing metrics for all operations.

4. **Identify API Bottlenecks**:
   The most common causes of slow reactions are:

   - OpenAI API delays (most common)
   - External API timeouts (weather, Wolfram Alpha)
   - Large conversation context sizes
   - Plugin execution overhead

5. **Adjust Timeouts**:
   You can modify timeouts in `.env`:

   ```
   # Add these to your .env file
   OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
   EXTERNAL_API_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
   ```

6. **Reset the Bot**:
   If ChimpGPT becomes unresponsive:
   ```bash
   pm2 reload chimpGPT --update-env
   ```
   This will restart the process and reload environment variables.

### PM2 Log Management

Logs are stored in the `~/.pm2/logs/` directory:

- `chimpGPT-out.log` - Standard output logs
- `chimpGPT-error.log` - Error logs

```bash
# View only error logs
tail -f ~/.pm2/logs/chimpGPT-error.log

# Search logs for specific error patterns
grep -i "error" ~/.pm2/logs/chimpGPT-out.log
```

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard

The built-in performance monitoring dashboard provides insights into bot operations:

1. **Access**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/performance.html` (development mode) or `http://localhost:3000/performance.html` (production mode)
2. **Features**:
   - API response time charts
   - Processing time breakdowns
   - Detailed operation metrics
   - Recent calls with timing information

This dashboard is particularly useful for identifying which operations are causing slow reactions.

# Save the PM2 configuration

pm2 save

# Check status

pm2 status

````

The bot should now be running and ready to interact in your Discord server.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **General Interaction**:
Simply send a message in a channel where the bot is present to engage in a conversation. The bot implements a rate limiter that allows 30 requests per 30 seconds, with a 5-second cooldown after hitting the limit.

2. **Weather Inquiry**:
Ask the bot about the weather, for example: "What's the weather like in New York?"
And it will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide a natural response using the RapidAPI accurate weather information.

3. **Time Inquiry**:
Ask the bot for the current time, like: "Whats the time in New York?"
And it will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to provide a natural response including the time.

4. **Quake Server Stats**:
Use the command `!serverstats` or `/serverstats` or ask about Quake servers to get detailed information about active Quake Live servers, including player counts, maps, and ELO ratings.

5. **Wolfram Alpha Queries**:
Ask factual or computational questions, and the bot will use Wolfram Alpha to provide accurate answers.

6. **Slash Commands**:
The bot supports Discord's slash commands. Type `/` to see available commands:
- `/help` - Display information about available commands
- `/ping` - Check if the bot is responding
- `/serverstats` - Display Quake Live server statistics

### Architecture Benefits

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Core, services, web, middleware are logically separated
- **Easier navigation**: Related files are grouped together
- **Better maintainability**: New developers can quickly understand the structure
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new services or features in appropriate directories
- **Standard conventions**: Follows Node.js project best practices

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Logging

The bot uses Pino for structured JSON logging. You can configure the logging level in the `.env` file:

```env
# Available log levels: fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
LOG_LEVEL="info"

# Environment mode - set to 'production' or 'development'
NODE_ENV="development"
````

In development, logs are formatted with colors for better readability. In production (when `NODE_ENV` is set to "production"), logs are output as JSON for better integration with log management systems.

### Port Configuration

The bot uses different ports for its status and health endpoints based on the environment:

```env
# Server port configuration
# Production port (used when NODE_ENV=production)
PROD_PORT=3000
# Development port (used when NODE_ENV=development)
DEV_PORT=3001
```

This allows you to run multiple instances (development and production) on the same machine without port conflicts. The status page and health check endpoints will automatically use the appropriate port based on the `NODE_ENV` setting.

Each component of the application has its own logger instance for better organization and filtering:

- `discord` - Discord client events and interactions
- `openai` - OpenAI API requests and responses
- `quake` - Quake server stats functionality
- `weather` - Weather lookup functionality
- `wolfram` - Wolfram Alpha integration
- `time` - Time lookup functionality

## 🖼️ Profile Picture (PFP) Management

Chimp-GPT can automatically update its profile picture using AI-generated images. To enable this feature, ensure the following requirements are met:

### Bot Permissions
1. **OAuth2 Scopes**: The bot must be invited with these scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`

2. **Server Permissions**: The bot's role needs:
   - `Change Nickname` permission

3. **Discord Limitations**:
   - The bot can only change its avatar if it's in fewer than 100 servers
   - Avatar changes are rate-limited by Discord (recommended: no more than 1-2 changes per 10 minutes)

### Configuration
By default, the bot will:
- Save generated images to the `pfp/` directory (not tracked in git)
- Rotate the profile picture every 10 minutes
- Keep a maximum of 50 most recent images

### Troubleshooting
If the bot doesn't update its avatar:
1. Check the logs for permission-related errors
2. Verify the bot has the correct permissions in the server
3. Ensure the bot is not in more than 100 servers
4. Check if the `pfp/` directory exists and is writable

### Quake Server Stats

You can configure the ELO display mode in `quakeLookup.js` by changing the `eloMode` value in the CONFIG object:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  // ELO display mode:
  // 0 = Off (don't show ELO)
  // 1 = Categorized (Scrub/Mid/Pro)
  // 2 = Actual ELO value
  eloMode: 1,
  maxServers: 3,
};
```
