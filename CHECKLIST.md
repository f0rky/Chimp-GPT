## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues/Items to Fix (from Code Review)

- [x] **GPT Image-1 integration fixes:**

  - [x] Fix URL extraction from GPT Image-1 API response to handle different response formats
  - [x] Add better error handling and logging for image generation
  - [x] Update status display to show meaningful actions instead of "to username"

  - [x] Fix parameter naming: use `output_format` instead of `response_format` for GPT Image-1
  - [x] Add timing and cost details to image generation output
  - [x] Implement rate limiting for image creation (5 per hour per user, unlimited for owner)

- [x] **Enhanced status updates:**

  - [x] Add progress indicators for long-running operations (counters, elapsed time)
  - [x] Update loading icon/message for delayed responses
  - [x] Implement contextual status updates for image generation (showing both generating and completed phases)
  - [x] Implement contextual status updates that change every 5 seconds for long API calls
  - [x] Respect global rate limiter for status updates
  - [x] Add more detailed context to status messages for ongoing operations

- [x] **Granular plugin error logging:** Enhanced error logging in pluginManager.js to include detailed context such as plugin name, version, author, argument details (sanitized), timestamp, error type/code, and hook type for easier debugging.
- [x] **Circuit breaker/retry for external APIs:** (OpenAI API calls now use retry and circuit breaker logic) No evidence of a true circuit breaker or retry/backoff logic for OpenAI, weather, or Quake integrations. Add robust retry/circuit breaker patterns to handle flaky APIs.
  - [x] **Human-in-the-loop circuit breaker:** Implemented comprehensive human approval system that integrates with the existing circuit breaker. Added ability to request owner approval for sensitive operations with detailed notifications and slash commands for approving/denying requests.
  - [x] **Bot versioning and self-query:** Implemented comprehensive version system with self-query capabilities. Added version command, natural language version queries via @[@prompt], and integrated version info into the human circuit breaker system and status page.
- [x] **Persistent conversation history:** Implemented persistent conversation storage with automatic loading on startup and saving on shutdown, plus periodic saving to prevent data loss. Added backup and recovery mechanisms for corrupted files, automatic pruning of old conversations, and status reporting.
  - [x] **System message preservation:** Ensure the system message (bot personality) is always preserved at index 0 (done).
- [x] **Test coverage:** Significantly improved test coverage by adding comprehensive tests for core features:
  - [x] **Image generation tests:** Added tests for DALL-E integration, image downloads, and circuit breaker patterns
  - [x] **Message handler tests:** Added tests for command parsing, message filtering, and error handling
  - [x] **Rate limiter tests:** Added tests for different configurations, multiple users, and specialized limiters
  - [x] **Conversation persistence tests:** Added tests for saving, loading, pruning, and error recovery
  - [x] **Test runner:** Updated to include all new tests and ensure proper execution
- [x] **Prettier config/enforcement:** Added Prettier configuration (.prettierrc), integrated with ESLint, and set up Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged to enforce code formatting standards.
- [x] **Contributor documentation:** Added comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for new contributors, including setup instructions, workflow, coding standards, and issue reporting.
- [x] **Plugin command name conflict validation:** Added validation to prevent duplicate command names across plugins during registration, with conflict tracking and detailed logging.
- [x] **Plugin README improvement:** Enhanced plugins/README.md with detailed hook documentation, fallback behavior explanation, and improved examples.
- [x] **Advanced error handling:** Implemented comprehensive error handling system with custom error classes, utility functions, and detailed documentation.
- [x] **Security review:** Review OpenAI/Discord API usage for security best practices (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting on commands, API key rotation). Created comprehensive security review document with recommendations.
  - [x] **Input sanitization:** Implemented comprehensive input sanitization across all external API integrations (OpenAI, Weather, Time, Wolfram Alpha, Quake) to prevent injection attacks and ensure secure data handling.
  - [x] **API key management:** Created a centralized API key management system with usage tracking, error monitoring, and rotation support. Updated all external API integrations to use the secure key manager.
- [x] **Upgrade undici:** Upgrade undici to version 6.21.2 or later to fix Dependabot security alert in package-lock.json.
- [x] **Docker/CI/CD:** Added Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD. Created comprehensive deployment documentation and container configuration for easier deployment and automated testing.
- [x] **User preference storage:** Added persistent user preferences system with support for ELO display modes and emoji toggles.
- [x] **Command-line run modes:** Added support for different run modes via CLI args (production, development, test, demo) with the runModes.js module and start.sh script. Implemented component-specific startup options (bot-only, status-only) and demo mode with mock data generation.
- [x] **Debugging configs:** Added VSCode debugging configurations in .vscode/launch.json for the combined app, bot-only, status-only, and test debugging.
- [x] **Configurable bot name, hostname, port (status page):** Status page now supports BOT_NAME, STATUS_HOSTNAME, and STATUS_PORT environment variables for flexible deployment (done). Fixed issues with app variable reference in statusServer.js to ensure proper startup.
- [x] **Emoji toggles and ELO display for Quake stats:** Added SHOW_TEAM_EMOJIS, SHOW_SERVER_STATS_EMOJIS, and ELO_DISPLAY_MODE environment variables. Team/spectator formatting improved (done).
- [x] **Image gallery modal/mobile/error handling:** Status page image gallery includes modal viewer, mobile support, and robust error handling (done).
- [x] **Logger standardization (Pino):** All main modules now use Pino-based logger for error handling and debugging. Test/CLI files reviewed for consistency (done; see README for details).

## Targeted Function Enhancement: `greeting`

### Instructions

- **Assessment:** Begin by conducting a thorough examination of the 'greeting' function, noting any discrepancies, limitations, or areas ripe for enhancement.
- **Modification:** With meticulous care and a bold vision, rewrite or augment the existing code. Whether it be through introducing new algorithms, refining dialogue models, or integrating advanced forms of witty banter, your expertise will lead the way.
- **Test and Feedback Loop:** Implement the modified functionalities and observe them in action. Engage in a cycle of testing and refinement, with each iteration guided by the principles of creativity, efficiency, and user delight.

## High Priority (Easier Implementation)

### Code Structure & Architecture

- [x] Refactor the weather API integration to use a single consistent approach (now unified on weatherLookup.js, legacy code removed)
- [x] Consolidate error handling patterns across modules (Logging is now standardized across all main modules with Pino-based loggers. Error handling is consistent and robust.)
- [x] Add stricter type-checking for plugin interfaces and function arguments (JSDoc or TypeScript) (JSDoc/type coverage is comprehensive across all major modules and plugin interfaces. Minor gaps may remain for new code.)
- [x] Logger standardization: All main modules now use Pino-based logger. Test/CLI files reviewed for consistency.
- [x] Add more granular logging for plugin execution errors (e.g., identify which plugin/hook failed)
