# ChimpGPT Implementation Checklist

## High Priority (Easier Implementation)

### Code Structure & Architecture

### Security Improvements

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data (weather, time lookups)
- [ ] Add retry logic for external API calls
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling for the bot

## Medium Priority

### Functionality Enhancements

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Set up Jest or Mocha for unit testing
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks with Husky to enforce linting/testing

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Create contributor documentation and guidelines
- [ ] Implement debugging configurations (VSCode/other IDEs)
- [ ] Add proper command-line arguments for different run modes

## Lower Priority (More Complex Implementation)

### Code Structure & Architecture
- [ ] Create a proper error handling system with customized error classes

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API interactions
- [ ] Add test mocks for external dependencies (OpenAI, Discord, etc.)
- [ ] Add type checking with TypeScript or JSDoc + TypeScript checking
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline

### Security Improvements
- [ ] Review OpenAI API usage for potential security concerns
- [ ] Add protection against Discord-specific exploits

### Functionality Enhancements
- [ ] Implement message components (buttons, select menus) for interactive responses
- [ ] Add user preference storage (database/file-based)
- [ ] Add voice channel capabilities for audio responses

### Deployment & Operations
- [x] Implement a health check endpoint for monitoring
- [ ] Add automated backup system for user conversation data
- [ ] Set up Docker containerization for easier deployment
- [ ] Implement proper versioning and release management
- [ ] Add automated rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create a status page or dashboard for bot health

## Completed Items

### Code Structure & Architecture
- [x] Implement a proper modular architecture (separate message handling from bot initialization)
- [x] Move function calls/definitions in chimpGPT.js to their own modules
- [x] Add logging infrastructure beyond console.log (Pino)
- [x] Fix main file reference in package.json (references messageHandler.js but main file is chimpGPT.js)
- [x] Implement a proper command router/handler system instead of direct message checks
- [x] Add JSDoc documentation to all functions
- [x] Organize codebase with clear directory structure (utils, archive, commands)
- [x] Create a proper configuration management system instead of accessing process.env directly
- [x] Rename main file from MOK_PLoW.js to chimpGPT.js for better clarity and consistency

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Configure a proper ESLint ruleset (it's installed but minimally configured)

### Performance & Reliability
- [x] Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
- [x] Add telemetry/monitoring to track bot performance and usage
- [x] Optimize conversation management for memory efficiency
- [x] Implement rate limiting for API calls to prevent quota issues

### Security Improvements
- [x] Implement proper secrets management beyond .env files
- [x] Add environment variable validation on startup
- [x] Add input validation for all user inputs
- [x] Implement proper sanitization for outputs to prevent injection issues
- [x] Create proper .env.example file with documentation for required environment variables

### Functionality Enhancements
- [x] Implement a permissions system beyond channel restrictions
- [x] Add more configurable options for the Quake server stats display
- [x] Implement compact display format for Quake server stats to maximize Discord character limits
- [x] Create a help command with dynamic command discovery
- [x] Implement a command cooldown system to prevent abuse
- [x] Add slash command support (Discord's preferred interaction method)

### Deployment & Operations
- [x] Create proper deployment documentation beyond PM2 basics
- [x] Set up proper Git repository structure with appropriate security practices

### Developer Experience
- [x] Set up a development environment with hot reloading (properly configured nodemon)
- [x] Create development vs. production environment separation
- [x] Add script aliases for common development tasks
- [x] Improve the README with detailed setup instructions and architecture documentation
- [x] Archive legacy code for reference while maintaining a clean working codebase
