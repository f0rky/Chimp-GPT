# Status Page Layout Redesign Plan

## Current Layout Analysis
- 11 separate cards with significant redundancy
- Poor information grouping and hierarchy
- Inefficient use of screen real estate
- Memory data spread across 3 different cards

## Proposed New Layout Structure

### Top Row - Critical Status (Always Visible)
**Single Wide Status Bar**
- Bot Status + Uptime + Version + Discord Ping
- Performance Alert Indicators
- Quick Action Buttons (Tests, Reset Stats)

### Second Row - Real-Time Operations (Most Important)
**Left: Live Performance (2/3 width)**
- Combined metrics: Response Time, CPU, Memory in one view
- Real-time chart with key metrics overlay
- Alert indicators for performance issues

**Right: Current Activity (1/3 width)**  
- Recent API calls summary
- Active function calls
- Current rate limit status

### Third Row - API & System Health
**Left: API Status & Usage**
- Combined API calls and errors in single card
- Doughnut chart + error indicators
- Recent API health status

**Right: System Resources**
- Memory details + system info
- Plugin status and health
- Connection status

### Fourth Row - Historical Analysis (Collapsible)
**Full Width: Detailed Analytics**
- Performance history with multiple time ranges
- Detailed function call logs and results
- Error analysis and trends

### Bottom Row - Administrative (Collapsible by default)
- Detailed plugin information
- Rate limit details and user lists
- Test results and diagnostics

## Benefits of New Layout
1. **Reduced Scrolling**: Critical info visible in top 2 rows
2. **Better Grouping**: Related information consolidated
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Details available but not overwhelming
4. **Improved Hierarchy**: Most important info gets most visual weight
5. **Better Mobile Experience**: Logical stacking order for small screens
