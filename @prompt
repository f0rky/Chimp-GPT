# AI Code Review & Checklist Completion Prompt for ChimpGPT

You are tasked with continuing a thorough code review and implementation audit for the ChimpGPT Discord bot project. Your goal is to systematically address and complete all items in the project’s `CHECKLIST.md`. This checklist covers code quality, architecture, testing, security, extensibility, and forward-looking enhancements.

## Instructions

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**
   - Review the project’s structure, major modules, and documentation (README.md, CHECKLIST.md, and relevant code files).
   - Understand the bot’s primary technologies: Node.js, OpenAI API, Discord.js, plugin system, and status page.

2. **Systematically Work Through the Checklist**
   - Open `CHECKLIST.md` and review all sections, including “Issues/Items to Fix,” “High/Medium/Lower Priority,” and “Forward-Looking Enhancements & AI Potential.”
   - For each unchecked item:
     - Assess the current implementation in the codebase.
     - Identify what changes or additions are required to fully address the item.
     - Implement the necessary changes, following best practices and the project’s coding standards.
     - Mark the item as complete in the checklist, providing a brief summary of the change in a commit message or checklist note.

3. **Maintain Consistency and Quality**
   - Ensure all new code is well-documented and tested.
   - Use the project’s logger for error handling (avoid `console.error` in main modules).
   - Follow modular and extensible design patterns, especially for new features.
   - Update or add documentation and tests as needed.

4. **Prioritize Forward-Looking Enhancements**
   - For the “Forward-Looking Enhancements & AI Potential” section, propose clear implementation plans or prototypes if full completion is not feasible in one pass.
   - Document any research, architectural proposals, or open questions for future contributors.

5. **Communicate Progress**
   - For each completed checklist item, provide a concise summary of what was changed and why.
   - If you encounter blockers or ambiguities, document them clearly for human maintainers or future AI contributors.
